Here are some of my work...

I usually do much more than this... But these are the only ones I felt I should preserve and are worth hoisting somewhere...
Most of the code here are my own work and they are not to be distributed or profited from without my consent.
If you got into this repository with permission feel free to modify or redistribute any code here in legimate fashion under
the terms of GPL V2. If you use any of the code present here in a way with intention to harm others and/or me I will not be responsible and I reserve the right to prosecute you in any way I please.
