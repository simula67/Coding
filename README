This is some crappy stuff I do when I am bored.
Most of this is usually very small and done in a hurry to solve a very particular problem or to learn something very fast.
Some of this stuff may be offensive.
Some may be totally useless.
If you run some of this stuff, it may format your hard drive, send naked pictures of you to everyone in your email address book, or send your personal data to FBI.
